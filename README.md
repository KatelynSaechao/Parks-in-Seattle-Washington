## Examined Geographic Area
For this map, I chose Seattle to be the examined geographic area.

## Available zoom levels of each tile set
For each tile set, I set the minimum zoom level to 3 and the maximum zoom level to 14. So, the available zoom levels are from 3 to 14.

## Brief Description of Each Tile Set

### *First layer: Edited Basemap*
This tileset is the first layer and it was a basemap that I created using mapbox. I originally started with a monochrome theme and then I altered the colors of this basemap so that the basemap turned blue. I also changed the text font for all labels to be Barlow.

### *Second layer : Parks*
Data Source: [Seattle Parks and Recreation Production](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::park-boundary-centroids/explore?location=47.615686%2C-122.351524%2C11.74)
This tileset is the second layer and it simply shows the location of all parks located within the Seattle, Washington boundary. These parks are indicated by the green dots on this layer.

### *Third layer : Edited Basemap and Parks*
This tileset is the third layer and it show both the first and second basemap simultaneously. This means that the basemap appears blue like the first layer and that the park locations on this map look exactly like points on the second layer.

### *Fourth layer : Environment Theme*
This tileset is the fourth layer and it shows a themed map that I created on mapbox. The theme for this map is the environment because I am interested in environmental research. I also made this theme because parks are related to the environment and wilderness. I chose to make the land green because nature is often viewed as being primarily green. Additionally, I chose to make the water blue, because water is typically shown as being blue in nature.
